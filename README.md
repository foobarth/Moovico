Moovico
=======

Moovico is a fast and extensible MVC framework and ORM based on PHP.

*Please note that Moovico, in its current state is far from being usable.
Please stay tuned and if necessary ask before relying on this code for mission
critical stuff :)*


Features
--------

* PHP based so installable on literally any (shared) host environment.
* Comes with a free MySQLi database interface (more databases to come).
* Includes an Object relational mapper with CRUD interface.
* Can work both RESTful or action based.
* Extensible via plugin/event-interface.
* Powerful regex based request routing.
* Talks json, xml, html, plaintext out of the box.
* Ideal companion for ExtJS/Sencha applications.
* **Buggy as hell.** for now.


Requirements
------------

* A webserver (duh!) - tested on lighttpd/php-cgi and nginx/php-fpm
* PHP >= 5.3 with mysqli-support if you want to use the connector.
